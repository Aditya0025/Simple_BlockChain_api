At this point, the idea of a chain should be apparent—each new block contains within itself, 
the hash of the previous Block. This is crucial because it’s what gives blockchains immutability: 
If an attacker corrupted an earlier Block in the chain then all subsequent blocks will contain incorrect hashes.
