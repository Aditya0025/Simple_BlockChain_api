At this point, the idea of a chain should be apparent—each new block contains within itself, 
the hash of the previous Block. This is crucial because it’s what gives blockchains immutability: 
If an attacker corrupted an earlier Block in the chain then all subsequent blocks will contain incorrect hashes.

static method is the method where do not use sef to  the method variable




############################## HASHING WITH SHA-256

from hashlib import sha256
x = 5
y = 0  # We don't know what y should be yet...
while sha256(f'{x*y}'.encode()).hexdigest()[-1] != "0":
    y += 1
print(f'The solution is y = {y}')

hash(5 * 21) = 1253e9373e...5e3600155e860

A proof of work is the how new blocks are created or mined on the blockchain. The goal of the pow is to discover 
a number which solve a problem. the number must be difficult but easy to verify -computationally 
speaking- by anyone on the network.
